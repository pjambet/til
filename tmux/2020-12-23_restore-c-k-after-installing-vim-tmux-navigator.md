# Restore C-k after installing vim-tmux-navigator

[vim-tmux-navigator](https://github.com/christoomey/vim-tmux-navigator) is great but I realized that I had lost the `C-k` mapping to kill the end of the line, a la emacs.

Turns out I could follow the instructions on [the README](https://github.com/christoomey/vim-tmux-navigator#restoring-clear-screen-c-l) but with C-k instead, and voila!
