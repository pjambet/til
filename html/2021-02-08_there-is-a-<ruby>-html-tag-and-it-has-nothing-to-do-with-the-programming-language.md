# There is a <ruby> html tag and it has nothing to do with the programming language

Quoting the link below:

> The HTML <ruby> element represents small annotations that are rendered above,
below, or next to base text, usually used for showing the pronunciation of East
Asian characters. It can also be used for annotating other kinds of text, but
this usage is less common.  The term ruby originated as a unit of measurement
used by typesetters, representing the smallest size that text can be printed on
newsprint while remaining legible.
