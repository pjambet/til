# Automatically add anchors

> AnchorJS lets you drop deep anchor links (like these) onto any webpage, and be on your way.

> You don't need to set up IDs or worry about urls. AnchorJS will respect your IDs if you have them, and generate them if you don't.

This will be great to add on sites I'm building like https://blog.pjam.me/ and I wish more sites would use something like that (looking at you AWS docs!)
