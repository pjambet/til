# `git pull` is like `git fetch` and `git merge`

Prezto uses the `gfm` alias for `git pull`, which didn't make sense for me at
first but then I remembered that it's because in a way, `git pull` is
essentially a combination of other commands. A quick google search pointed at
this SO answer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/292359/919641

> In the simplest terms, git pull does a git fetch followed by a git merge.

So that explains the alias, `gfm`, **g**it, **f**etch & **m**erge
